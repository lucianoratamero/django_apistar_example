django_apistar_example
======================

This project is just a sample of what and how we could implement using `django_apistar <https://github.com/lucianoratamero/django_apistar>`_ as base.

To run it, you just need to clone this project, create a virtualenv and install it's dependencies using ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.

To run the API Star server, use ``python manage.py run`` and to run using the default django server, run ``python manage.py runserver`` as usual.

This is a django project, so be sure to run ``python manage.py migrate`` before playing with API Star's docs (at the ``/docs/`` url) or django admin (at the ``/admin/`` url).

And be sure to visit my mais project, `django_apistar <https://github.com/lucianoratamero/django_apistar>`_! Thanks a lot!
